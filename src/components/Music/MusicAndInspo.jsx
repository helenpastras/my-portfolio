I am both surprised and fascinated by the very random range of genres I turn to for audio support while working. 

Times of downloading, analyzing, ideating, or strategizing, I find my soundtrack to be one of the following:

Instrumental Jazz (working that math brain!)

Lounge / melodic house

Deep house

World (my version of it, anyway!)

Classical

Operas 

Yet, at times of rapid prototyping, documenting, furnishing Confluence pages, Jira epics/tickets, sketching ideas and wireframes, or composing presentations, I find my soundtrack to be one of these:

House

Electronic

Trance

80's/90's Metal

Industrial metal

Thrash

Happy pop

And then, there are the tunes reserved for meetings, collab sessions, facilitation, and presentations. Yes, I love to start meetings with a song or waiting music soundtrack. Empirical data has taught me to run creative sessions with a soundtrack, as people relax and let go, delivering their best ideas and their truths! These are a total mashup, as the type of music or specific song is selected to share a story, an emotion, match, and surround a specific moment. Some genre examples are: 

New wave

Rap/rock

Funk

Movie tunes/Soundtracks

Jazz/Bossa Nova

World (again, my version of it - see playlist)

Greek rock/alternative (it is amazing to watch people react to the music when they don't understand the lyrics!!)
